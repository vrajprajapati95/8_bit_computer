# 8-Bit Computer Simulation in Proteus

This project is a simulation of an 8-bit computer based on Ben Eater's schematics, implemented in Proteus. The simulation aims to replicate the basic functionalities of a simple computer architecture, focusing on educational purposes and understanding the fundamentals of computer design.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, you'll need Proteus Design Suite installed on your computer. If you haven't already, you can download it [here](https://www.labcenter.com/).

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Proteus installed with all necessary components and libraries for microcontroller simulation.

### Installing

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/8-bit-computer-proteus-simulation.git
   ```

2. Open Proteus and import the project file (`project.pdsprj`) located in the repository.

## Running the Simulation
1. Open Proteus.
2. Load the project file (`project.pdsprj`).
3. Double-click on the main simulation component to start the simulation.
