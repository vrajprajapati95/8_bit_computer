# 8-Bit Computer Simulation in Proteus

This project is a simulation of an 8-bit computer based on Ben Eater's schematics, implemented in Proteus. The simulation aims to replicate the basic functionalities of a simple computer architecture, focusing on educational purposes and understanding the fundamentals of computer design.

## Getting Started
To run the simulation, you'll need Proteus Design Suite installed on your computer. If you haven't already, you can download it [here](https://www.labcenter.com/).

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Proteus installed with all necessary components and libraries for microcontroller simulation.

### Installing
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vrajprajapati95/8_bit_computer.git
   ```

2. Open Proteus and import the project file (`project.pdsprj`) located in the repository.
## Running the Simulation
1. Open Proteus.
2. Load the project file (`project.pdsprj`).
3. Double-click on the main simulation component to start the simulation.

## Built With
- [Proteus Design Suite](https://www.labcenter.com/) - Electronic design automation software.
