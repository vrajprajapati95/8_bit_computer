# 8-Bit Computer Simulation in Proteus

This project is a simulation of an 8-bit computer based on Ben Eater's schematics, implemented in Proteus. The simulation aims to replicate the basic functionalities of a simple computer architecture, focusing on educational purposes and understanding the fundamentals of computer design.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, you'll need Proteus Design Suite installed on your computer. If you haven't already, you can download it [here](https://www.labcenter.com/).

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Proteus installed with all necessary components and libraries for microcontroller simulation.

### Installing

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vrajprajapati95/8_bit_computer.git
   ```

2. Open Proteus and import the project file.

## Running the Simulation

1. Open **Proteus Design Suite**.  
2. Load the main project file:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [8_bit_computer_overview.pdsprj](https://github.com/vrajprajapati95/8_bit_computer/blob/main/8_bit_computer/1_MAIN_overview/8_bit_computer_overview.pdsprj)  
3. Click the **Run Simulation** button to start the simulation.  
4. Observe the working of the 8-bit computer and modify components as needed.  

## Built With
